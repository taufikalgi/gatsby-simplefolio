## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\
Also you need to have installed [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
gatsby-cli@2.8.22 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️

```
yarn@v1.21.1 or higher
```

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd gatsby-simplefolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm run develop
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start development server
$ yarn develop
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:8000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server:

## Deployment 📦

Once you have done with your setup. You need to put your website online!

I highly recommend to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to achieve this on the EASIEST WAY
